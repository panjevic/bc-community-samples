#Explanation for tests: (-) not implemented (+) implemented

---Test character token---
What we know/what is needed:
- Contract will be a ERC721 contract in its base.
- Character is a structure holding attributes
- Has a list of unique characters owner by users (millions hopefully)
- Some attributes are immutable, some are mutable
- Immutable attributes are generated with some enthropy (?)
- Mutable attributes are all set to a default minimum
- Mutable attributes are upgradable to their maximum.
- Mutable attributes are upgradable by incremental steps.
--- TBD stuff ---
- Trading of cards pays up a % to contract balance
- Minting, token sale, monetization etc
- Character balancing (during the first period, f.ex. one month)
- Mutable attributes change doable by the "Game contract"
- Later we should empose stricter rules to disable possible cheating by upgrades from different game contracts (tBD)

Tests:
1.(+) Contract ERC721 deployed
1.a (+) Contract ownership
2.(+) Create and put character in array, is the same character in array
3.(+) Put another character in array, are there 2
4.(+) Is the second character in array the one we put in
5.(+) Only enabled minter can mint
6.(+) Check if immutable attributes are within a range guaranteeing enthropy
6.(+) Check if immutable attributes are within the allowed range
7.(+) Check if mutable attributes are within the allowed range
8.(+) Check if minting with defaults gives correct values
9.(+) Change the mutable attribute
10.(+) Change the mutable attribute above the maximum
